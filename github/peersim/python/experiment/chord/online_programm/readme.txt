programm simulates onlinerate effect for propagation
only talk about onlinerate, no two factor

use delay to make the propagation much longer so that we can see the effect of onlinerate on the propagation

onlinerate change from the time > 2
index = currenttime - 3(start index from 0)
use the second onlinerate method which uses the random set online nodes
cpu_cores = 4
id_length = 16...
