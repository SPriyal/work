Overview
--------

fcapture currently consists of two programs: fcapture(1), which reads packet
data from a pcap(3) source, notes flow information (including IP addresses,
port numbers, packet/byte counts, and TCP flags) and writes dump files in a
special "fcap" format; and fcapdump(1), which reads fcap files and dumps them
in human readable format to stdout.  fcapdump is flexible in that it can read
gzipped dump files as well as tar/gzip archives of multiple dump files.

Limitations
-----------

fcapture(1) is currently limited to the IPv4 network protocol and TCP/UDP
transport protocols.  flow start time and duration are precise only to seconds
resolution.

fcapdump(1) lacks a flexible bpf-like syntax for filtering fcap files.  it can
only filter by individual /32 IP address.

Building
--------

fcapture has been tested on Linux, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD.

Build dependencies on Linux are:

    libjudy-dev libpcap0.8-dev

FreeBSD:

    gmake Judy

OpenBSD:

    gmake libJudy

Running
-------

If running on Linux, I recommend using the high performance PACKET_MMAP
variant of libpcap, available from

    http://public.lanl.gov/cpw/
or
    http://people.debian.org/~edmonds/libpcap-mmap/
        (Debian packages)

A Debian init script is included.  The /etc/default/fcapture file controls
whether to start fcapture daemons from the init script ("ENABLED") and which
fcapture instances ("INSTANCES") to start.  Instances are the names of config
files in the /etc/fcapture directory and specify the capture interface,
capture packet length, log path, and BPF filter.  An example instance config
could be:


INTERFACE=eth0
LOGPREFIX=/var/log/fcap/`hostname`.$INTERFACE
FILTER="ip proto \\tcp or ip proto \\udp"
PCAP_SNAPLEN=96


While fcapture(1) can be run from the init script or daemonized with the -d
and/or -P options, I instead recommend a supervision utility like runit or
daemontools as fcapture(1) produces useful statistics on stderr if not
daemonized.  If using the MMAP libpcap on Linux, a supervision run script might
look like this:


#!/bin/sh
exec 2>&1

export INTERFACE=eth1
export BPF="ip proto \\tcp or ip proto \\udp"
export LOGPREFIX=/var/log/fcap/mynetwork

export PCAP_MEMORY=262144
export PCAP_VERBOSE=1
export PCAP_STATS=0x406
export PCAP_PERIOD=60000
export PCAP_SNAPLEN=96

exec fcapture -i $INTERFACE -f "$BPF" -l $LOGPREFIX
